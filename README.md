# various-physics-sims
This is a repo that houses all of the physics sims I've created of topics I'm interested in.

## current, in-progress goals
* Update the Navier-Stokes representation for the pipe simulation
* Incorporate a Torsion Pendulum sim using a library like three.js

## future goals
* Traveling Wave Tube Amplifier Sim - need to build a better understanding first
* Gauss's Law Sim - create custom surfaces in a conducting/nonconducting sphere/shell
  * Shows the math behind it
* Geodesic Lines and Einstein's Theory of Relativity
